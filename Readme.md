# 🌆 Urban Heat Island (UHI) Prediction Using Remote Sensing

This project focuses on predicting the **Urban Heat Island (UHI)** effect in urban centers using satellite-derived data, specifically Land Surface Temperature (LST) from Landsat imagery. The goal is to provide data-driven insights into how urbanization and surface characteristics influence localized temperature increases, which are becoming increasingly severe due to climate change.

## 🌍 Why This Matters

Climate change is intensifying extreme heat events, particularly in urban areas where concrete and asphalt dominate the landscape. These environments absorb and retain more heat than natural ecosystems, creating the **Urban Heat Island effect**—a major environmental and public health concern.

Understanding and predicting UHI dynamics is critical to:
- Mitigating health risks for vulnerable urban populations,
- Informing sustainable urban planning,
- Supporting climate-resilient infrastructure development.

## 🎯 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Alignment

This project directly supports the following United Nations SDGs:

- **🛡️ SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-being:**  
  UHI exacerbates heat-related illnesses. Accurate prediction can inform early warnings and public health interventions.

- **🌆 SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities:**  
  By analyzing spatial heat patterns, city planners can design greener, more resilient urban environments.

- **🌡️ SDG 13 – Climate Action:**  
  Modeling urban heat dynamics contributes to broader efforts in understanding and adapting to climate change.

- **🌳 SDG 15 – Life on Land:**  
  Understanding land surface changes and their thermal impacts helps guide urban greening efforts that support biodiversity and ecosystem health.

## 📡 Approach Overview

The project leverages multi-temporal satellite data, particularly thermal infrared bands from Landsat, to estimate and analyze land surface temperatures in urban areas. It integrates geospatial processing and machine learning techniques to detect spatial patterns and predict UHI intensities.
